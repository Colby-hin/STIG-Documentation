# STIG: WN11-CC-000205 – Diagnostic data collection must be limited

## Identifiers

- STIG ID: WN11-CC-000205  
- Vulnerability ID: V-253266  
  

---

## System

- System: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro 64-bit (Azure virtual machine, x64), standalone  

---

## Finding

Diagnostic data (telemetry) was not restricted to the required minimum setting.  
The system allowed a higher level of telemetry than permitted by the STIG baseline.

Registry Location:
 HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection

Required Configuration:
- Name:  AllowTelemetry
- Type:  REG_DWORD  
- Value:  0

---

## Security Impact

If telemetry is not limited:

- Additional system and usage data may be transmitted externally.
- Sensitive operational details could be exposed unnecessarily.
- The system does not meet DISA data minimization requirements.
- Increased compliance risk with DoD security standards.

---

## Remediation

Adjusted the policy-backed registry setting to restrict diagnostic data collection.

### PowerShell Remediation Script

```powershell
# Create the registry path if it does not already exist
New-Item -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection" -Force | Out-Null

# Set telemetry to Security level (0)
Set-ItemProperty `
    -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection" `
    -Name "AllowTelemetry" `
    -Type DWord `
    -Value 0
```
Validation Command

```powershell
Get-ItemProperty `
    -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection" `
    -Name "AllowTelemetry"
