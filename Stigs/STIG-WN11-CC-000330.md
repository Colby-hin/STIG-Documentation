# STIG: WN11-CC-000330  
The Windows Remote Management (WinRM) client must not use Basic authentication

---

## Identifiers
- STIG ID: WN11-CC-000330
- Platform: Windows 11 Pro 64-bit (Azure VM)

---

## Finding

The WinRM client was configured to allow Basic authentication.

Basic authentication transmits credentials in a weakly protected format and does not meet secure authentication requirements.

---

## Security Impact

If Basic authentication remains enabled:

- Credentials may be exposed to interception.
- Increased risk of credential harvesting.
- Elevated risk of unauthorized remote access.
- System remains non-compliant with DISA STIG requirements.

---

## Remediation

Configured the WinRM client policy to disable Basic authentication.

### PowerShell Remediation Script

```powershell
# Ensure policy path exists
New-Item -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client" -Force | Out-Null

# Disable Basic Authentication
Set-ItemProperty `
    -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client" `
    -Name "AllowBasic" `
    -Value 0 `
    -Type DWord
```

---

## Validation

### PowerShell Validation Command

```powershell
Get-ItemProperty `
    -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client" `
    -Name "AllowBasic"
```

Expected result:

AllowBasic = 0
Since the value is 0, any subsequent attempts to use Basic authentication for WinRM will fail.
